### Retail API Service

##### API

The Retail API is a BFF edge service that contains all API endpoints for searching inventory and purchasing products. This API does not require authentication. This API is not documented. You must pull all of the inventory search and product purchasing endpoint from the existing code, document them in Swagger, and reimplement them in the new Retail API Service.

##### Backing Services

The Retail API Service communicates with the following backing services:

* Level Up
* Order
* Inventory
* Product
* Customer

##### Business Rules

* 10 Level Up points are awarded for each $50 purchased.
* These points are not pro-rated.
  * For example:
    * A $49 order gets zero Level Up points.
    * A $99 order gets 10 Level Up points.
    * A $110 order gets 20 Level Up points.
* Level Up points are submitted when the order is submitted.
* Level Up points totals are returned as part of the completed invoice.
* Order quantity must be greater than zero and less than or equal to the number of items in inventory.
* Orders must contain valid products.
* An order must contain a valid customer.

##### Architecture Requirements

* Level Up points must be submitted to the Level Up service via a queue.
